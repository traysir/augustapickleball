    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>By registering for the Augusta Pickleball Club, you agree to play in accordance with league rules, good sportsmanship, and at your own risk. We are not liable for injuries, lost items, or weather interruptions.</p>
    <p>Each team is responsible for timely attendance and communication. Registration is confirmed once payment is received. Refunds are considered only before week two of the season.</p>
    <p>We may update these terms as needed. Continued participation in the league after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.</p>
